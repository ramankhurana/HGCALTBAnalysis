## before runing this setup you have to mount EOS area using: 
eosmount eos1 

## You can use HGCALTBAnalyzer.py script  to analyse the RECO TB trees and save many Histograms for further analysis. 

## To save histogram for extracthing the offsets for each cell and each amplitude cut use: 
python HGCALTBAnalyzer.py -e 

## The text file and rootfiles with graphs can be saved using: 
python ExtractOffSetFactors.py

## Once all the offsets are extracted we can now apply them on each cell and each energy and each amplitude cut. 

## To save histograms which has the offsets applied run the code using: 
python HGCALTBAnalyzer.py -a 

## This will loop over the files in a directory and run on each of the files in this directory. You have to give file path in the "inputrootfiles.txt" 

## You can use the output to get the offset factors for each cell. This is done using just one single histogram (TH3D) with X axis: amplitude, Y axis: time, Z axis: cell number 

## 



## You can run the following command to save all the fit plots in a directory for each energy point and some more plots which are used to interpret the results.
